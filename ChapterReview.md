1.	A class in C++ is a user defined type or data structure declared with keyword class that has data and functions (also called methods) as its members whose access is governed by the three access specifiers private, protected or public (by default access to members of a class is private). 
2.	Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of data hiding.
Data abstraction refers to, providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details, i.e., to represent the needed information in program without presenting the details.
C++ classes provides great level of data abstraction. They provide sufficient public methods to the outside world to play with the functionality of the object and to manipulate object data, i.e., state without actually knowing how class has been implemented internally.
Data hiding means to hide the members of the class and providing the access to only some of them. we can make the members of the class private or public. in private,the outside world cannot access those members which been made private.and rest we can make public.only the public members are accessed by the out side world and all the private members can be accessed using only the public members.in this way a class provides security to its data members.
3.	An object is an instance of a class, a class is like a blueprint and an object is like a house built from this blueprint.

6.	Constructor is a special function in a class that is called when a new object of the class is created.
Destructor is a special function of a class that is called when the created object is deleted.

8.	A default constructor is one which can be called with no arguments. The constructor is the way to have every object determine its initial value, and the default constructor invokes these initial values automatically once an object is created.
